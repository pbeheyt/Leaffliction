Foreword

“No,” Arthur said, “look, it’s very, very simple. . . . All I want. . . is a cup of tea. You are

going to make one for me. Now keep quiet and listen.”

And he sat. He told the Nutro-Matic about India, he told it about China, he told it

about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun. He told it about silver

teapots. He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting the

milk in before the tea so it wouldn’t get scalded. He even told it (briefly) about the East

India Trading Company.

“So that’s it, is it?” said the Nutro-Matic when he had finished.

“Yes,” said Arthur. “That is what I want.”

“You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?”

“Er, yes. With milk.”

“Squirted out of a cow?”

“Well in a manner of speaking, I suppose. . . ”

“I’m going to need some help with this one.”

Douglas Adams, The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe

Introduction

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and under-

standing digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in

order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions.

Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input

of the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can

elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of

symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry,

physics, statistics, and learning theory.

General rules

• You have to render your modules from a computer in the cluster either using a

virtual machine:

◦ You can choose the operating system to use for your virtual machine

◦ Your virtual machine must have all the necessary software to realize your

project. This software must be configured and installed.

• Or you can use the computer directly in case the tools are available.

◦ Make sure you have the space on your session to install what you need for all

the modules (use the goinfre if your campus has it)

◦ You must have everything installed before the evaluations

• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double

free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be

considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.

• We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work

won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded . It will give you a chance

to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially

useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests

and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.

• Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git reposi-

tory will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done

after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during

Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.

• You are free to use any language of your choice for this project but we advise you

to do it in python because there are many libraries that can help you, if you do

this project in python , it must respect the norm.

◦ pip install flake8

◦ alias norminette_python=flake8

• By Odin, by Thor ! Use your brain !!!

You are free to use any language of your choice for this module.

Chapter IV

Mandatory part

IV.1 Part 1: Analysis of the Data Set

Write a program named Distribution.[extension] that takes as arguments a directory and

fetches images in its subdirectories. This program, and therefore you, must then extract

and analyze/understand the data set from the images and prompt pie charts and bar

charts for each plant type - your program must also retrieve the name of the directory in

order to name the chart’s colones accordingly.

$> find . -maxdepth 2

./Apple

./Apple/apple_healthy

./Apple/apple_apple_scab

./Apple/apple_black_rot

./Apple/apple_cedar_apple_rust

$> ./Distribution.[extension] ./Apple

Example of expected output:

Your program must work with all the directory in the data set

IV.2 Part 2: Data augmentation

You realize that the data set is not balanced.

You have to balance your number of images for each variety and disease.

Here is a list of examples of techniques you can use:

• Flip

• Rotate

• Skew

• Shear

• Crop

• Distortion

You must display 6 types of data augmentation for each image given to your program,

they must also be saved with the original file name followed by the name of the type of

augmentation.

$> ./Augmentation.[extension] ./Apple/apple_healthy/image (1).JPG

Example of expected output:

$> ls

image (1)_Flip.JPG

image (1)_Rotate.JPG

image (1)_Skew.JPG

image (1)_Shear.JPG

image (1)_Crop.JPG

image (1)_Distortion.JPG

You have to place the new images in the existing directory to

balance your data set. You will need to return this data set in

an "augmented_directory" for evaluation.

IV.3 Part 3: Image Transformation

You can use whatever language you want. However, we recommend that you choose a

language with a library that facilitates image-processing workflow like plantCV

Different methods of direct extraction of characteristics from an image of a leaf need

to be implemented. Once again, you must display at least 6 image transformations.

$> ./Transformation.[extension] ./Apple/apple_healthy/image (1).JPG

Example of expected output:

Figure IV.1: Original Figure IV.2: Gaussian blur

Figure IV.3: Mask Figure IV.4: Roi objects

Figure IV.5: Analyze object Figure IV.6: Pseudolandmarks

Figure IV.7: Color histogram

If your program is given a direct path to an image, it must display your set of image

transformations. However, if it is given a source path to a directory filled with multiple

images, it must then save all the image transformations in the specified destination di-

rectory.

For example:

$> ./Transformation.[extension] -src Apple/apple_healthy/ -dst dst_directory -mask

Think to make your own usage to facilitate the choice of the

arguments with ./Transformation.[extension] -h

To allow a fast evaluation, it goes without saying that you will

create your own data set from the images by following all these steps

beforehand. Beware, the evaluation will assess whether your program

is working well on small data sets.

IV.4 Part 4: Classification

In this part, you must write a program named train.[extension] that takes as parameter

a directory and fetches images in its subdirectories. It must then increase/modify those

images in order to learn the characteristics of the diseases specified in the leaf. Those

learnings must be saved and returned in a .zip that also includes your increased/modified

images.

$> find . -maxdepth 2

./Apple

./Apple/apple_healthy

./Apple/apple_apple_scab

./Apple/apple_black_rot

./Apple/apple_cedar_apple_rust

$> ./train.[extension] ./Apple/

For evaluation, you will need to write a second program that retrieves your learnings.

It must take as arguments a path to an image from your learnings, displays the original

image and the transformed image, and that gives the type of disease specified in the leaf.

For example:

$> ./predict.[extension] ./Apple/apple_healthy/image (1).JPG

You have to separate your data set in two parts, one for Training and one for Valida-

tion. The predictions of your validation set must also have an accuracy above 90% (you

must be able to prove it in an evaluation, with a minimum of 100 images in the validation

set).

Make sure you don’t have any knowledge about the validation set or on overfitting

prior to the assessment, so your results don’t look suspicious.

Chapter V

Turn-in and peer-evaluation

Turn your work in using your GiT repository, as usual. Only your programs and the

signature.txt must be present in your repository.

Indeed, you must also deposit a signature.txt file at the root of your Git repository in

addition to your code. This file must be a hash of your DB which includes everything you

need to run your programs correctly, i.e. your dataset in sha1 format and the training of

your model.

Then, retrieve the signature from the ".zip" file of your data set in sha1 format.

Below are 4 command examples for a directory.zip file:

• Windows: certUtil -hashfile directory.zip sha1

• Linux: sha1sum directory.zip

• For Mac M1: shasum directory.zip

• MacOS: shasum directory.zip

This is an example of what kind of output you will get:

• 7a18a838d2203cc7d6e8c4c521fdd4dd214aa560 directory.zip

It is of course FORBIDDEN to turn in your data set in your Git

repository. During the defense, the signature of the signature.txt

file will be compared with the one of your data set. If the two of

them are not identical, your grade will be 0.
